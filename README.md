## Step 1: Logging In

If you don't already have an account you can create one by clicking the login/sign up page

From there you will get a username and password which will allow you to login and save restaurants for the future.

## Step 2: Finding the perfect place!

You can use one of two categories to find a restaurant: Location(borough) or Cuisine type. These two categories will help you find a restaurant that is perfect for your tastes or nearby enough to enjoy!

## Step 3: Saving a restaurant

When you find a restaurant you think is perfect, you can click on the name of the restaurant to go to a page with more information. You can then add the restaurant to your saved restaurants list for late access.

To access your saved list, you can simply find it under the search bar which will allow you to remove any you have added.
