If you don't already have an account you can create one by clicking the [Login/Sign Up page](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1spNrO2frEO-ix8ULXqaGivYR5HXJHzKA/view?usp=sharing).

## Step 2: Finding the perfect place!

You can use one of two categories to find a restaurant: [Borough or Cuisine](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-ZcqJPrLl0DteSEglvk8Svw0jtFZ2YrS/view?usp=sharing). These two categories will help you find a restaurant that is perfect for your tastes or nearby enough to enjoy!
